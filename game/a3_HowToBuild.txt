This file is about how to build a3.  
For more information about a3 itself, run a3 or
look at the usage information at the bottom of a3.d.  

a3 is written in the D programming language.

To build a3, a D compiler is required.  
Such a compiler can be found for both Windows and Linux here:

Another D compiler which supports more targets but is 
harder to install can be found here:
http://dgcc.sourceforge.net/



Assuming you use DMD (the first one), your session will look like this:
dmd a3.d -o-

... and out pops a3.exe.  Then you use a3.exe to do whatever.
You're done.  That's it.
